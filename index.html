                    <p>Thank you for taking a minute to review and provide your opinon on the upcoming Academic Course Evaluation application.  You will be reviewing 2 proposed workflows for students to fill out evaluations.</p>

                    <p>Below are 2 sample sets that are being considered.  In both samples it reflects a student who is registered for 3 courses for the quarter, 1 course of which is available for evaluation.  Both samples ask you the exact same questions presented differently.</p>

                    <p>While reviewing the pages, please keep in mind that you may be doing an evaluation for each of your courses.  What would encourage you to fill out an evaluation?  What would prevent you from filling out an evaluation?  What was easy?  What wasn't?</p>

                        <strong>Explanation:</strong>

                        <p>In this sample, a course evaluation is broken into seperate evaluations.  Each class time (ie. lecture, discussion, lab, etc.) will have a distinct evaluation to be filled out.  In this case each of the individual evaluations can potentially have different start and end times and need to be completed for a complete course evaluation.</p>

                        <p>In this sample, each course will have a single evaluation.  Questions will be asked about each class time (ie. Lecture, Discussion, Lab, etc.) and each instructor in a single evaluation.  In this case each course could have a different evaluation start time, but only one evaluation will be done for each course.</p>
